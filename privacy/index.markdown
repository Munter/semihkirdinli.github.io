## What? Why Have A Privacy Policy?

Well, you wouldn't want Haacked.com sharing all sorts of deeply
personal information about you, would you? Well of course not. Besides,
some affiliate programs require a privacy policy. So here you go, a
privacy policy.

## Besides Your Rear, What Does The Policy Cover?

This privacy policy covers how Haacked.com treats personal information
it receives from visitors. It gives the average reader the assurance
that his or her personal information is safe from Big Brother and other
prying eyes.

## How Do You Guarantee Privacy?

As in life, there are no perfect guarantees. However, as Haacked.com
doesn't require registration, it really doesn't have much information to
share in the first place.

## What Information Do You Collect?

This site doesn't itself collect data. It's a static site hosted on GitHub Pages.
However, I do use Google Analytics so it's worth looking at [Google Analytic's privacy policy](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html). 
I also use Disqus for comments, so take a look at the [Disqus's privacy policy](http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466259-privacy-policy).


## What About Cookies?

See the previous answer about Disqus and Google Analytics.

## So Who Do You Share This Information With?

Absolutely nobody, other than occasionally posting aggregate stats about my blog on occasion.

## Even If I Offered You 10 Million Dollars?
Let's talk off-line in private.... er... I mean NO! Absolutely Not.
Haacked.com doesn't gather any information worth selling.
